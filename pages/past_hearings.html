	37,000 (as of Q3 2014) units have their entitlements, but they don't have their building permits. Why? Are they waiting in line at DBI? Are they still going through EIR lawsuits? Is the land being sold?</p>

		a symmetrical process in response to Jane Kim's April 21 Housing Balance Monitoring legislation. Housing Balance monitoring was prompted by Prop K, which articulates 2 policy goals:<br>
		(1) build 30,000 units/ year by 2020 (equivalent to 5,000 units/ year)<br>
		(2) 30% of these should be deed restricted affordable units to < 55% median income workers, 50% should be deed restricted affordable for < 120% median income workers.<br>
		The housing balance legislation monitors progress on the 2nd policy goal. Which is fine. But SF citizens deserve a similar process to monitor progress towards the implied goal of 5000 units per year. SF did not get to its goal of 5000 last year - We need a hearing and a bi-annual report examining the laws, policies, procedures that are getting in the way of building 5000 units per year.<br>
		<p>
		The point of both of these hearings/ reports/ data collection processes is to justify law changes. For Jane Kim, she wants to find, next spring, that SF has NOT reached it's 30% goal and therefore, should require a Conditional Use Permit for any new market rate housing unit that will cause the ratio of new MR to new Subsidized to go above 70:30.
		</p>
		<p>
		If SF does NOT reach its implied goal of 5000/ units per year and therefore, should relax height and density restrictions, or, therefore, should hire more planners or building inspectors or, therefore ... ?? Something else. Thus the questions:
		What are the law changes that we most need to get housing production going?
		What kinds of data would support those law changes?

			<h3><a href="http://www.sfdemocrats.org/">Should the SF Democratic Party endorse the Moratorium? NO.</a></h3>
			<h4>May 27, 7:00 pm (arriving at 8pm is fine) - 10:00pm, about</h4>
			<h4>455 Golden Gate Avenue</h4>
			<p>Here is <a href="https://d3n8a8pro7vhmx.cloudfront.net/sfdemocrats/pages/13/attachments/original/1431922211/Agenda-Packet-2015-05-27-v04.pdf?1431922211">the agenda</a></p>
			<p><a href="http://www.48hills.org/2015/05/27/sf-democratic-party-votes-against-the-mission/">Success - DCCC did not endorse 13-10</a></p>
			<p>Politics: SF has 800,000 + people. Perhaps you thought, as I used to, that means you have to get tens of thousands of people to agree with you to make an impact. That is False. As it turns out, the number of people who care about local politics, or pay attention to what is happening in it is Much Much fewer than 800,000. It's maybe 2,000 people all in all, and as few as 400 actually influential people. That it plenty small enough that personal lobbying makes a difference. SO, Wednesday evening, come lobby the DCCC personally.</p>
			<p>"Why bother, the DCCC isn't a law making body. They are to government as <a href="https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5782108/1/Harry_Potter_and_the_Methods_of_Rationality">HPMOR</a> is to Harry Potter, right?"
			WRONG - politics is all about everyone trying to figure out what everyone else thinks. Being successful in politics requires maintaining a mysterious and ethereal quality called legitimacy. How does one maintain such a thing? By looking around all the time - 'what do you think, what do you think, what do you think?' Initiatives and individuals seek approval and support from individuals and groups. Here, the moratorium is looking for endorsement from a club of politicos and interested citizens. It will be a blow if the Democratic party declines to endorse it, and a coup if they do endorse it.</p>
			<p>
			If you want the moratorium to fail, here and at the Board of Supervisors, come to this meeting May 27th, and bring a friend.</p>
			<p>This is plenty late in the evening for all of you peninsula workers to be able to make it up from the Caltrain.

			<h3><a href="https://localwiki.org/sf/600_S_Van_Ness">27 units, 600 S Van Ness</a></h3>
			<h4>May 21, 2:30 pm - 5:00pm, about</h4>
			<h4>Planning Commission, SF City Hall, Room 400</h4>
			<p><a href="http://sanfrancisco.granicus.com/MediaPlayer.php?view_id=20&clip_id=22866#">Hearing starts at 1 hour 50 minutes</a></p>
			<p>Success! Approved! 7-0</p>
			<p>27 units in the mission. This is part of the moratorium campaign. Same way we saw people just outside the area covered by the corona heights legislation, (and hoping to soon get it) argue that their neighborhood projects should be stopped, the mission nimbys are going to argue that the moratorium might happen soon so this should be stopped.</p>
			<p>I know these kinds of things seem discouraging, because there might be only like 4 of us but 20 or more of them, but the planners WANT to say yes. They are sitting up there waiting for ANY excuse. Even a small number of us gives them that excuse. Plus, they know we're not professionals at rabble rousing. They know we have jobs, so for every one of us they see, there are 15 more plugging along in an office in soma or on the peninsula. </p>
